Test Problems				
				
Three problem categories have been created with the problem generators described in [H00] that contain different sized items and objects. 				
Each problem category contains five test problems. 				
The test problems have been constructed such that the optimum solution is not known, but the number of objects is large enough to accommodate all items. 				
The item dimensions have been generated randomly with the longer side ranging between 10% and 100% of the object width.				
After all items have been created, their dimensions have been scaled by a factor (>1) so that the five problems in one category have roughly the same total item area.

Test Problems from the Literature				
				
The problems cgcut1 – cgcut3 [CW77] and gcut 1 - gcut 13 and ngcut 1 - ngcut 12 [B85bc] are based on test problems known from the literature.				
				
These test problems are 2D cutting problems, which were transformed to 2D bin packing instances according to [MV98] 				
by first ignoring the value of the item and 				
secondly by generating the maximum number of items for each type (for cgcut and ngcut).

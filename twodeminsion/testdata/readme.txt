A data set for the two-dimensional cost knapsack problem.

The data set naming format is set+number+letter_.txt
1. The number represents the type of object, and the number in the same data set is the same.
2. There are different letters after the same set, _p.txt, _w.txt and _b.txt store the profit,
 weight and volume of the object, _c.txt and _v
Then the weight limit and space limit of the set backpack are stored, and _s.txt is the optimal
 solution of the data set.

The data in each file is split by line LF, you can use'\n' to split
